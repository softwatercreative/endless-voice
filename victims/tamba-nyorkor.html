      Police were called to the 9700 block of Clocktower Lane in Columbia on
      Oct. 8, 2008, at approximately 7:30 p.m., after a woman reported a man
      inside an apartment appeared to be injured or deceased. Paramedics and
      police arrived and found Nyorkor dead from a gunshot wound. He was 26
      years old. Also in the apartment at the time were his two toddler-age
      children. They were not injured.
