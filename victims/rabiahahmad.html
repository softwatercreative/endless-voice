    <p>
      Police continue to seek information regarding the homicide of Rabiah
      Ahmad, 30, and her baby Ahja on July 31, 2020. Rabiah was 28 weeks
      pregnant when she was shot while inside a residence in the 6600 block of
      Dovecote Drive in Columbia. She later died at the hospital. Doctors
      delivered Ahja, who remained in critical condition until she died Aug. 5.
      Detectives do not believe that Ahmad was targeted and are still working to
      determine the motive in the shooting.
