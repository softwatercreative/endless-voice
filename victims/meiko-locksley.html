    <p>
      On Sept. 3, 2017, Meiko Locksley, 25, was found suffering from a gunshot
      wound around 10:20 p.m. in the 5500 block of Harpers Farm Road. He was
      transported to the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center, where he
      was pronounced dead. Although detectives have not identified a suspect,
      they believe the case likely was not random. They have been looking into
      every potential motive, including robbery, the possibility that it may
      have been drug-related or the result of an ongoing dispute.
