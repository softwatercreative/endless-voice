    <h1>About Endless Voice</h1>

    <p>
      There’s a disturbing gap in the digital landscape when it comes to the
      unresolved cases in Howard County. Today, information on these cold cases
      is buried in outdated government websites or scattered across sketchy web
      pages cluttered with unrelated ads. As a result, the victims—whose stories
      deserve to be told—have virtually no web presence, and the cases
      themselves receive only sporadic coverage from local outlets like ABC or
      WBAL. Maryland needs a dedicated platform to amplify the voices of the
      victims and bring their stories into the light.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>

    <p>
      We are committed to transforming the way cold cases are approached in
      Howard County by creating a modern, centralized resource that highlights
      the victims, documents each case, and provides a secure channel for the
      community to offer tips. Our goal is to honor the memory of the victims
      and galvanize public support for renewed investigative efforts.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Solutions</h2>

    <p>
      Centralized Website: We are building a comprehensive home website for
      Howard County Cold Cases. This modern platform will serve as a reliable
      resource, presenting detailed information on each case alongside ways for
      the public to submit tips. Dedicated Victim Pages: Each of the 26 victims
      will have a dedicated web page, complete with unique links that are easily
      shareable across various online platforms. This ensures every story can
      gain the visibility it deserves and potentially reach a wider audience.
      Fundraising for Sustainability: To keep this resource accessible and free
      from the start, we will launch fundraising campaigns to cover the initial
      setup and future hosting costs. Your support is vital in sustaining this
      platform. Community Connection: We aim to connect with the wider Crime
      Solvers Community, inviting collaboration and collective action. Together,
      we can foster an environment where every case is actively revisited and
      every tip is valued. Join us in our mission to create a space where every
      voice is heard, every case is spotlighted, and every effort to bring
      justice is amplified. Your support helps ensure that no victim is
      forgotten and that the pursuit of truth continues with unwavering resolve.
